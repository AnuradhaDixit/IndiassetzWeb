                    Put very simply a passive investor is someone who invests passively with the help of some hands-off strategies, 
                    meaning they have no active role in day-to-day operations or managing the asset that they invest in. 
                    Some popular methods include:

                    Hence the major difference between the two is that the passive investor typically contributes
                    investment capital only while active investors take that capital and then do something with it.
                    The choice between passive and active real estate investing ultimately boils down to your <span class="text-highlight">financial

                        <b>Active Investment:</b> Imagine you're an active real estate investor looking to flip houses. You find a property in need of renovation for $200,000, spend $50,000 on renovations, and sell it for $300,000, earning a profit of $50,000.
